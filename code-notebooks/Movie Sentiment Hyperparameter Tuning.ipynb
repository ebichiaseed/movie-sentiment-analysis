Given the large number of hyperparameters available, we focused on those most influential on model performance.\n","\n","We begin by using RandomisedSearchCV, which efficiently samples a fixed number of hyperparameter combinations from predefined distributions, providing a broad exploration of the parameter space with reduced computational cost.\n","\n","Based on these preliminary results, we then employ GridSearchCV to exhaustively evaluate all combinations within a narrowed hyperparameter grid, fine-tuning the models for optimal accuracy.\n","\n","Due to computational constraints, hyperparameter tuning was not performed for SVM with a linear kernel.\n","\n","After tuning all models, our results indicated that the TF-IDF combined with Logistic Regression delivered the best performance with the highest accuracy."],"metadata":{"id":"B_0RXcgnHFGI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#
